# Bouncing Balls in Spinning Hexagon

A Python/Pygame simulation of colored balls bouncing inside a rotating hexagon with realistic physics including gravity, friction, and ball-to-ball collisions.

## Features

- **Rotating Hexagon**: A white hexagon spins continuously clockwise
- **Multiple Balls**: Add/remove colored balls with buttons
- **Physics Simulation**:
  - Gravity pulls balls downward
  - Friction slows ball movement
  - Realistic wall bounces with adjustable bounciness
  - Elastic ball-to-ball collisions with momentum conservation
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - "Add Ball" button creates new randomly colored balls
  - "Remove" button deletes the most recently added ball
  - "More Bouncy" button increases wall bounce energy retention
  - "Restore Bounce" resets bounciness to default

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame (`pip install pygame`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
