# Bouncing Balls in Spinning Hexagon

A Python/Pygame simulation of colored balls bouncing inside a rotating hexagon with realistic physics including gravity, friction, and ball-to-ball collisions.

## Features

- **Rotating Hexagon**: A white hexagon spins continuously clockwise
- **Multiple Balls**: Add/remove colored balls with buttons
- **Physics Simulation**:
  - Gravity pulls balls downward
  - Friction slows ball movement
  - Realistic wall bounces with energy loss
  - Elastic ball-to-ball collisions with momentum conservation
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - "Add Ball" button creates new randomly colored balls
  - "Remove" button deletes the most recently added ball

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame (`pip install pygame`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nickythomas/Grok3-HexagonBounce.git
cd bouncing-balls-hexagon
